          <h3>Finding Most Profitable CPC / 13.09.2018</h3>
            <p>Situation:</p>
            <p>- We are trying to earn money by affiliating each partner in AppJobs by using their dedicated links.</p>
            <p>- There are affiliate platforms that send us their feed including cities and their prices. i.e. Uber / San Antonio / 1,54$.</p>
            <p>- Cities in AppJobs may not be included in those feeds. So, we need to find closest possible city and use its link and price.</p>
            <p><br>Solution:</br></p>
            <p>- We needed a common / universal parameter that can be used for matching cities and other values. Using zip-code was a good idea for this. (Offered by CEO)</p>
            <p>- I found a file that includes all cities in USA with their zip codes and coordinates.</p>
            <p>- Affiliate platforms added zip codes into their feeds as well. So we are able to see coordinates and zipcodes for each city in the feed</p>
            <p>- We have coordinate values for cities in our database as well. So by using index / match formulas in spreadsheet, we found closest possible cities.</p>
