          <h3>Finding Most Profitable CPC</h3>
            Situation:
            - We are trying to earn money by affiliating each partner in AppJobs by using their specific links.
            - There affiliate platforms that send us their feed including cities and their prices. i.e. Uber / San Antonio / 1,54$
            - Cities in AppJobs may not be included in those feeds. So, we need to find closest possible city and use its link and price.
            Solution:

        </div>
